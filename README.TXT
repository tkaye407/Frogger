Welcome to Tyler Kaye's Version of Frogger
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was made mostly to learn more about JAVA GUI's and to experiment with different ways of recreating the logic behind Frogger. Thus, the graphics have not been emphasized in this game.

How to play: 

1. git clone https://github.com/tkaye407/Frogger.git
2. javac FroggerUI.java
3. java FroggerUI
